Alexa, What Will Amazon Disrupt Next? Taking a 
Closer Look at Ring & Amazon's Smart Home 
Strategy

We are continuing our series that takes a closer look at Amazon’s innovative and
disruptive investment areas.We kicked off our series last week looking at Amazon’s 
grocery strategy and Whole Foods integration (here), and in this note we focus on
Ring and Amazon’s smart home strategy. We believe the smart home category 
represents a significant growth opportunity for Amazon, with ~29M connected homes 
in the US (per McKinsey), including ~13M with active smart speakers (per 
comScore), and a long runway ahead with ~100M broadband homes in the US and 
nearly 1B globally. We estimate Amazon’s smart home TAM is ~$50B+ in the US, 
which assumes ~50M homes spending ~$1k on smart devices, and much larger 
globally. Beyond its market size, we believe the smart home is a strategically 
important category as it provides Amazon with an in-home presence, greater
access to data, and the potential to drive more shopping in other categories 
through Echo devices/Alexa. Amazon faces significant competition from other major 
tech platforms including Alphabet and Apple, traditional home security companies,
and more niche players such as smart lock maker August (acquired by ASSA
ABLOY). We believe Amazon is well positioned with its strong Echo/Alexa market 
share, while Ring provides Amazon with a competitive offering to Nest, and in our 
view Ring will prove to be a highly strategic asset that significantly improves
Amazon’s smart home offering and position in the home over time.

 What Is Ring? Amazon acquired Ring in February 2018 for a reported ~$1B+, 
making it one of the largest acquisitions in the company’s history behind Whole 
Foods. Ring is best known for its video doorbell, which launched in 2013 and is 
used by an estimated ~2M customers in the US (per IHS Market), representing a
~97% market share (per NPD). Ring expanded its product offering to include 
outdoor security cameras in 2016, and it has announced plans for a 2018 product 
roadmap that includes a home security system and indoor/outdoor camera (see 
Figure 3 for Ring’s full product suite). Ring more than doubled its revenue to
~$415M in 2017 (per media reports), has ~2,000 employees, and is a direct 
competitor to Nest. We note Ring and Nest products are becoming increasingly 
competitive, with Nest shipping its first video doorbell in March 2018 and Ring 
expected to launch its first indoor camera and security system later this year. See 
Figure 1 for a comparison of Ring and Nest smart product offerings.
